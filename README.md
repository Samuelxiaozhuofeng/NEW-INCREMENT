Incremental Everything
A RemNote plugin which allows you to interleave your flashcard reviews with notes, paragraphs from books, websites, video snippets and more! Heavily inspired by SuperMemo's Incremental Reading mode.

Features
Incremental Reading: Read and review 1000s of notes, books and websites in parallel. Learn more.
Incremental Writing: Write your essays and blog posts incrementally to maximize creativity. Learn more.
Incremental Video: Watch and take notes on your YouTube video backlog.
Incremental Tasks: Clear out your tasklist between flashcard reviews.
Incremental Exercises: Spread out textbook exercises over time.
Plugin support: Any RemNote plugin widget can easily integrate with Incremental Everything!
Installation
Open the RemNote plugin store, search for "Incremental Everything" and install the plugin.
Note that the plugin is temporarily disabled on mobile until I have time to fix some bugs.
